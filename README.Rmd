# `rigr`: Regression, Inference, and General Data Analysis Tools for R

# Introduction

`rigr` is a R package designed to facilitate easy adoption of regression and inference tools in R. `rigr`, formerly known as `uwIntroStats`, compiles output from existing routines together in an intuitive format, and adds functionality to existing functions. For instance, the `regress` function can perform linear models and generalized linear models. The user can also specify multiple-partial F-tests to print out with the model coefficients, and robust standard errors are provided automatically. We also provide functions for descriptive statistics and one- and two-sample inference with improved, legible output. 


## Installation 

You can install `rigr` from CRAN using the code below.

```
install.packages("rigr")
```

You can install the development version of `rigr` from GitHub using the code below.

```
devtools::install_github("statdivlab/rigr")
```

`rigr` is maintained by the [StatDivLab](http://statisticaldiversitylab.com/), but relies on community support to log issues and implement new features. Is there a method you would like to have implemented? Please submit a pull request or start a [discussion](https://github.com/statdivlab/rigr/discussions)!


## Documentation

Examples of how to use the main functions in `rigr` are provided in three vignettes. One details the `regress` function and its utilities, one details the `descrip` function for descriptive statistics, and the third details functions used for one- and two-sample inference, including `ttest`, `wilcoxon`, and `proptest`.
