Description: TODO A set of tools to streamline data analysis in R. Learning both R and introductory statistics at the same time can be challenging, and so we created rigr to facilitate common data analysis tasks and to enable learners to focus on statistical concepts. We provide easy-to-use interfaces for descriptive statistics, one- and two-sample inference, and regression analyses. Heteroskedasticity-robust ("sandwich") standard errors are included by default in all regression output, and multiple partial F-tests are easy to specify. A single regression function (`regress()`) can fit both linear and generalized linear models, allowing students to more easily make connections between different classes of models.
