\usage{
ttesti(
  obs,
  mean,
  sd,
  obs2 = NA,
  mean2 = NA,
  sd2 = NA,
  null.hyp = 0,
  level = 0.95,

}
\arguments{
\item{obs}{%% ~~Describe \code{var1} here~~ number of observations for the
first sample.}

\item{mean}{%% ~~Describe \code{var1} here~~ the sample mean of the first
sample.}

\item{sd}{%% ~~Describe \code{var1} here~~ the sample standard deviation of
the first sample.}

\item{obs2}{number of observations for the second sample (this is optional).}

\item{mean2}{if \code{obs2} is supplied, then sample mean of the second
sample must be supplied.}

\item{sd2}{if \code{obs2} is supplied, then sample standard deviation of the
second sample must be supplied.}

\item{null.hyp}{%% ~~Describe \code{var1} here~~ a number specifying the
null hypothesis for the mean (or difference in means if performing a
two-sample test). Defaults to zero.}

\item{level}{%% ~~Describe \code{var1} here~~ confidence level of the test.
Defaults to 95/100.}

\item{alternative}{%% ~~Describe \code{var1} here~~ a string: one of
\code{"less"}, \code{"two.sided"}, or \code{"greater"} specifying the form
of the test. Defaults to a two-sided test.}

\item{var.eq}{%% ~~Describe \code{var1} here~~ a logical value, either
\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} (default), specifying whether or not equal
variances should be presumed in a two-sample t-test. Also controls robust
standard errors.}

\item{prop}{if \code{TRUE}, performs a test of equality of proportions with
Wald based confidence intervals.}

\item{exact}{must be \code{FALSE} if \code{prop=FALSE}. If true, performs a
test of equality of proportions with Exact Binomial based confidence
intervals.}
}
\value{
Prints a summary of the data and the
corresponding t-test. \item{Variable}{\code{x} in a
one-sample test, or \code{x} and \code{y} in a two sample test. The first
set of descriptives entered goes to \code{x}.} \item{Obs}{Number of
observations of each variable: includes missing values.} \item{Mean}{the
sample mean; also, the estimated difference in means in a two-sample test.}
\item{Std.Err.}{the estimated standard error of the mean and of the
difference in the two-sample test.} \item{Std.Dev.}{standard deviation
estimates.} \item{CI}{a confidence interval for the means, and for the
difference in the two-sample test. This is at the confidence level specified
in the argument. If \code{prop} and/or \code{exact} are specified, also
returns the appropriate Wald or Exact Binomial based confidence interval.}
\item{Null hypothesis}{a statement of the null hypothesis.}
\item{Alternative hypothesis}{a statement of the alternative hypothesis.}
\item{t}{value of the t-statistic.} \item{df}{the degrees of freedom for the
test.} \item{Pr}{a p-value for inference on the corresponding hypothesis
test.}
}
\description{
%% ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
Produces table of relevant descriptive statistics and inference for either
one- or two-sample t-test. In the two-sample case, the user can specify
whether or not equal variances should be presumed. Can also perform a test
of equality of proportions, with the appropriate Wald or exact binomial
based confidence intervals.
}
\details{
%% ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~ Values must
be placed in the specified spaces, in place of the defaults. If \code{obs2},
\code{mean2}, or \code{sd2} is specified, then all three must be specified
and a two-sample t-test is run.
