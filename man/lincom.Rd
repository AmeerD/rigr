\title{%% ~~function to do ... ~~ Tests of Linear Combinations of Regression
Coefficients}
\usage{
lincom(
  reg,
  comb,
  hyp = 0,
  conf.level = 0.95,
  robustSE = TRUE,
  eform = reg$fnctl != "mean"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{reg}{an object of class \code{uRegress}.}

\item{comb}{a vector or matrix containing the values of the constants which
create the linear combination of the form \deqn{c_0 + c_1\beta_1 + \dots}.}

\item{hyp}{the null hypothesis to compare the linear combination of
coefficients against. The default value is \code{0}. An error will be thrown
if the number of columns of this matrix are not equal to the number of
coefficients in the model.}

\item{conf.level}{a number between 0 and 1, indicating the desired
confidence level for intervals.}

\item{robustSE}{a logical value indicating whether or not to use robust
standard errors in calculation. If \code{TRUE}, then \code{robustSE} must
have been \code{TRUE} when \code{reg} was created.}

\item{eform}{a logical value indicating whether or not to exponentiate the
estimated coefficient. By default this is performed based on the type of
regression used.}
}
\value{
%% ~Describe the value returned Prints a matrix with the point
estimate of the linear combination of coefficients, a p-value, and
confidence interval.
}
\description{
%% ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
Produces point estimates, interval estimates, and p values for linear
combinations of regression coefficients using a \code{ uRegress} object.
